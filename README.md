# Rebase With History ![David DM](https://david-dm.org/DeuxHuitHuit/rebase-with-history.png) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/rwh.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/rwh)

> Simple tool that adds the picked commit into the commit message

## Installation

```
npm i -g rwh
```

## WTF?

Fan of `git rebase` but you do not want to loose the original commit since people complained on it on github?
`rwh` has your covered.

It is a simple wrapper around the `git rebase` command, that will temporarily replace your `$GIT_EDITOR` with a automated one. This "editor" will reword the original commit and insert a new paragraph with the original commit sha1 reference. You use it the same way as with git, i.e. `rwh master`. It can be run multiple times.

```
